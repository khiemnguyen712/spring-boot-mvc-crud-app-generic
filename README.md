# MySuperSpringApp
A Spring Boot application implementing the MVC architecture to perform CRUD operations on a SQL database. ðŸš€

This project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to enable basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. A SQL script is included alongside the src files for database setup.

Spring JPA is used to interact with the database, Thymeleaf for rendering, and Bootstrap to make the front-end less of an eye sore.

This app is developed as a part of my study. The app lacks security, search along with many other features which should be updated in the near future as I learn more about Spring Boot.
